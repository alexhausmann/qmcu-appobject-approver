# qmcu-sheet-approver

##What it does
The Sheet Approver enables users to approve published sheets in an app, thus, making them base sheets of the Qlik Sense application. In addition, it's possible to un-approve sheets as well and push them back to the community.

##How it Works
To approve or un-approve sheets, qualifying items will have a clear checkbox. Click the checkbox to activate and then select the appropriate approve or un-approve button that is relevant to the selections made.

Sheet Approver facilitates multi-designer work flows in Qlik Sense applications by enabling user created sheets to become approved base sheets in an application through a simple interface.  Currently, there is no other way to make user created content base content in a Qlik Sense application.
